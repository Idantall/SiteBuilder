You are designing the public website for 82 Labs, an AI R&D studio specializing in custom software, AI automation and rapid MVPs. The site must feel premium and distinct — avoid the stock React template look. Use the “New Nature” concept (a fusion of organic and synthetic) for inspiration: incorporate subtle cell‑like or Voronoi patterns in backgrounds and icons, representing organic technology. The overall color palette should be dark‑mode first with deep navy/charcoal backgrounds and gradient accents that blend natural hues (emerald green, forest blue) with synthetic hues (coral orange, quartz pink). Provide a light mode toggle as well.

Typography is a key visual element: choose a bold, modern sans‑serif headline font (optionally a variable font with cut‑outs reminiscent of Voronoi shapes) and pair it with a clean body font; animate headings or key phrases on scroll for a kinetic feel. Use soft‑UI (neomorphism) throughout: cards and buttons should have subtle depth with soft shadows and gradients rather than flat backgrounds. Replace stock photos with custom illustrations or AI‑generated graphics that depict AI pipelines, futuristic labs or abstract data flows. Create smooth micro‑interactions (parallax backgrounds, fade‑in content, animated hover states) but keep them restrained for a professional finish.

Structure the site into clear sections with plenty of breathing space:
1. **Hero** — succinctly explain what 82 Labs does (custom AI software, automation, MVPs in weeks) with a bold multi‑coloured headline and two calls to action (“Get Started” and “Watch Demo”). Show abstract cell graphics floating in the background.
2. **Platform** — outline the core platform with highlights like “Infinitely Scalable” (auto‑scaling architecture, cloud‑native deployment) and “Enterprise Security” (end‑to‑end encryption, SOC 2 Type II, MFA). Each point should have its own card with a custom icon, gradient accent and short descriptive copy.
3. **Solutions** — use tabbed or pill navigation to let users switch between “Custom Software,” “AI Automation” and “MVP in Weeks.” Each tab reveals a short description and bullet features; style the tabs with soft gradients instead of plain pills.
4. **Industries we transform** — showcase the sectors you serve (e.g., technology, finance, healthcare, education) using cards with custom icons or illustrations; include a brief description for each.
5. **Research & Resources** — add a section for research articles, blog posts or case studies to establish credibility; list resources like white papers, videos or AI tutorials.
6. **Company** — briefly describe the team and mission and include links to careers or contact pages.
7. **Footer** — include navigation links, social icons and legal information; maintain the dark/light toggle.

Use React or Next.js for the build, but implement a custom design system (e.g., Tailwind CSS with a bespoke theme or Chakra UI with overridden styles) so the site does not resemble off‑the‑shelf components. Ensure responsiveness on mobile and desktop, with smooth breakpoints and touch‑friendly navigation. Prioritize accessibility: good contrast, keyboard navigation and ARIA labels. Add analytics hooks and placeholders for forms (e.g., “Request a Demo”). The end result should look like a bespoke, enterprise‑grade AI brand website rather than a generic template.
